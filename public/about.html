    <p> Hello, my name is Hector. I am 21 years old and I am currently a senior at the University at Buffalo, majoring in Psychology with a minor in Computer Science!</p>
    <p>  I was recently accepted into a PhD program for Social Psychology at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst. I hope to combine my computational skills from my minor</p>
        <p>to answer research questions within the field of social psychology. Outside of school, I enjoy listening to music, reading, and watching anime.</p>
