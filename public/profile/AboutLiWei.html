            <p> Junior, Computer Science Major</p>
            <p> I am a Computer Science Major studying at University at Buffalo, <br>
                and this website is a group project I worked on in CSE 370. <br>
                I and currently a junior and I want to pursue a career as a software <br>
                engineer with an interest in front-end design. I worked with my fellow <br>
                group members to make this website to bring together a community of <br>
                people who are looking to share and learn more about eating a healthy diet.</p>
