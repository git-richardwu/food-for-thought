    <p> My name is Richard Wu. I am a junior computer science student from the University at Buffalo. I possess a strong interest in front-end development
    and have prior experience developing applications in React. Growing up, I have always had an eye for design due to my interest in pursuing an art career. 
    While those ambitions have become more of a hobby, I now strive to use my creativity to help develop a seamless user experience that is also 
    visually appealing. In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, playing video games, and sleeping.
